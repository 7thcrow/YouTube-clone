- **Search Bar**: A search bar is present but does not have functional interaction, as the site is intended for practice purposes.

- **Responsive Design**: The site adjusts its layout for optimal viewing on different screen sizes. When the window width is less than 1000 pixels, the layout changes to display three videos per row instead of four, and the navigation bar becomes more compact
